# Instructions for Copilot: Set Up BootLauncherLite Project

## Context
This solution contains two projects:
- **BootLauncher** (the original project)
- **BootLauncherLite** (the new project copy)

## Tasks

### 1. Rename Namespaces
For the **BootLauncherLite** project, rename all namespaces from `BootLauncher` to `BootLauncherLite`.

### 2. Copy Dependencies
Copy all dependencies and references from the BootLauncher project to the BootLauncherLite project. Ensure that all NuGet packages, project references, and any other linked libraries match the setup in the original BootLauncher project.

## Steps
1. Focus only on the BootLauncherLite project directory.
2. Rename all namespaces as described above.
3. Copy the dependencies from the BootLauncher project file or from the Solution Explorer into the BootLauncherLite project so that both have the same references.
4. Verify that the BootLauncherLite project builds and runs correctly.

And that’s it! Just add that bit in, and Copilot should have all the instructions it needs.
